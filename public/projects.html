													<h3><strong>What are Subduction Zones?</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p>Subduction Zones are regions of the Earth where two tectonic plates collide. We call these convergent boundaries, and in some cases, Subduction can occur, where one tectonic plate slides or "subducts" under the other.</p>

												<p>After the model is constructed from a base benchmark example, geophysical parameters relating to real subduction zones around the world can be input to construct the slab geometry and simulation, effectively emulating the thermal evolution and behavior of major subduction zones around the world. </p>

													<h3><strong>Geodynamic Modeling - FEniCS Subduction Zones</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p>Subduction Zones host an incredible amount of important geological events, such as earthquakes, volcanism, and mineralizaton. However, despite their importance, subduction zone models are often poorly understood and complicated, rendering them difficult to understand and use for anyone other than experts.</p>
												<p>During my time at the <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/epl">Carnegie Institution for Science, Earth and Planets Laboratory</a>, in Washington, D.C., I worked with <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/dr-cian-wilson">Dr. Cian Wilson</a> to develop and improve a series of increasingly complex Geodynamic Models using <a href="https://fenicsproject.org/">FEniCSx</a>, an open source python library for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) via the finite element method (FEM). All code was developed in an online Jupyter Notebooks environment. </p>
												<p>At the culmination of my internship, I had implemented a time-dependent model of Subduction, as well as thermal diffusion, convection, and cornerflow. These models aim to be open source, free, and accessible for scientists, researchers, and hobbyists alike. The project is available on my <a href="https://github.com/cameronseebeck">Github</a> as well as on the official <a href="https://cianwilson.github.io/fenics-sz">project website.</a></p>

													<h3><strong>Deformation of the Lithosphere</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p>The Earth's crust is a dynamic place; It deforms and changes under stress, just like many other materials. Over millions of years, the Earth's surface and its appearance are heavily influenced by subsurface processes that operate primarily in the upper crust. Understanding these processes is the key to revealing the history and future of the Earth. Click the button below to learn more about the "Arizona Plano" and its evolution.</p>

													<h3><strong>What can we infer?</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p>By understanding how the Southwest Cordillera has evolved over time through extensional collapse of mountain ranges, as well as the subsequent thinning of the lithosphere, scientists can infer the time frame and history of various geological features, such as ore deposits, hot spots and MCCs (Metamorphic Core Complexes). Understanding the history and evolution of our dynamic Earth helps us appreciate processes that occur now and will continue to in the future.</p>

													<h3><strong>Understanding Earth's Surficial Morphology, Evolution and Features - A Modeling Approach</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p>Modelling the evolution of Earth's surface as a function of its subsurface processes is a complicated task. The question is- How can we use a deterministic model to infer important geologic processes and their consequences? This process starts with an interdisciplinary team of scientists who can contribute valuable information that may inform the accuracy of the model.</p>
												<p>By using a variety of techniques such as geochronologic dating, paleo-topographic inference, structural reference and many others, these newfound parameters can help constrain and rationalize our geodynamic models. With accurate, wide ranges of supporting data, a better picture can be painted of critical Earth processes involved in the formation and evolution of the Southwest Cordillera.</p>
												<p>While working at the Geodynamics lab at <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/geosciences/">Stony Brook University</a> under the guidance of PhD student Yucheng Wang and <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/geosciences/people/_faculty/holt.php">Dr. William Holt</a>, I helped run, test and infer information from a series of thermomechanical models in order to predict landscape and subsurface evolution.</p>
												<p>Code was written and tested in a suite known as <a href="https://www.underworldcode.org/intro-to-underworld/">Underworld</a>, a "parallel, python, particle-in-cell, finite-element code for Geodynamics" (underworldcode.org). The code library is open source, and relies on a set of high-performance numerical methods. You can find out more about the project background by reading this paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31903-2">here</a>.</p>
